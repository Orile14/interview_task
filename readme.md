## Script Versions Comparison

I've developed two versions of a script, both of which achieve the desired functionality. The primary difference lies in their structure:

### Version 1: Modular Approach
- **Structure:** Divided into two functions, each responsible for a specific functionality.
- **Readability:** More readable and easier to understand.
- **Efficiency:** Traverses the file multiple times.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to maintain due to clearer structure.

### Version 2: Single-Function Approach
- **Structure:** Written in a single function.
- **Readability:** Less readable and harder to understand.
- **Efficiency:** Traverses the file only once, making it more efficient.
- **Maintainability:** Harder to maintain due to its complex structure.

Both versions are correct and produce identical outputs. The choice between them depends on the project's priorities, where Version 1 prioritizes readability and maintainability, while Version 2 prioritizes efficiency.
